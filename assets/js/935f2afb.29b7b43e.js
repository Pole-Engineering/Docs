Once completed, you will have access to separate guides for each different section of the printer (gantry, Z-axis, frame, etc.). The reason we are not consolidating everything into a single document is that the printer potentially has more than 10 different configurations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"projects/Crossant 235/Build Guide/Bearings and Linear Rails":{"id":"projects/Crossant 235/Build Guide/Bearings and Linear Rails","title":"Bearings and Linear Rails","description":"Linear rails are a type of bearing. The Crossant uses linear rails for movement on each axis. Due to their working principles, linear rails and bearings require lubrication, and without it, they wear out over time and lose performance. On this page, we will discuss the terminology related to linear rails and bearings, as well as how to perform their maintenance.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"projects/Crossant 235/Build Guide/Belts":{"id":"projects/Crossant 235/Build Guide/Belts","title":"Belts","description":"The Crossant has a total of four belts to facilitate XY movement.
