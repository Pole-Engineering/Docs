# Gantry
>Here, you can find general information about the pulleys, idlers, shims, and tolerances for the Crossant.

## Pulley and Idlers
>There are many different sizes of pulleys and idlers available in the market. Our recommendation for idlers is those with an outer height of 13 mm and an inner height of 11 mm. For 
pulleys, we recommend those with an inner height of 11 mm and an outer height of 20 mm.
>
>With the Crossant, you can use both GT2 9 mm and GT2 10 mm belts. The design of the printer supports both sizes seamlessly.

## Pulley Stack Spacings
>In the gantry, there are two different pulley stack combinations. The first one has the idlers on top, and the second one has the idlers on the bottom. To make it easier to explain, let's call the combination with the idlers on top 'A' and the one with the idlers on the bottom 'B'.
>
>- **For combination A**, you need to use the following shims from top to bottom:
  - **Three** 0.5 mm shims, total of **1.5mm**
  - **Three** 0.5 mm shims, total of **1.5mm**
  - **Three** 0.5 mm shims, total of **1.5mm**
- **For combination B**, you need to use the following shims from top to bottom:
  - **Four** 0.5 mm shims, total of **2mm**
  - **Three** 0.5 mm shims, total of **1.5mm**
  - **Two** 0.5 mm shims, total of **1mm**
