# Assembly Guides
We are currently working intensively on the assembly guide for the Crossant235. Once completed, you will have access to separate guides for each different section of the printer (gantry, Z-axis, frame, etc.). The reason we are not consolidating everything into a single document is that the printer potentially has more than 10 different configurations.
