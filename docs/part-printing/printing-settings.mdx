# How the Print Settings Should be and Which Materials to Use?

We are suggesting to print the parts with following instructions.

## Print Settings

You can use two different printing settings to print the parts;

### Ultra Durable

#### We recommend this settings for ultra durability. Its strong but takes longer to print.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Settings</th>
      <th>Values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Layer Height</td>
      <td>0.2mm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Line Width</td>
      <td>0.4mm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wall Count</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top &amp; Bottom Layer Count</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Infill Pattern</td>
      <td>Honeycomb</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Infill Density</td>
      <td>%30</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### I Mean... It'll Work but Significantly Weaker

#### These settings suitable for impatients.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Settings</th>
      <th>Values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Layer Height</td>
      <td>0.28mm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Line Width</td>
      <td>0.4mm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wall Count</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top &amp; Bottom Layer Count</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Infill Pattern</td>
      <td>Gyroid, Cubic, Grid</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Infill Density</td>
      <td>%30</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## How the Printing Orientation Should be?

Every STLs that you will download from [Github](https://github.com/Pole-Engineering/Crossant-235) are exported with right printing orientation so dont need the change the order.

## How Can I Determine the Color and Quantity of the Pieces?

You can check the table to understand how the file naming works;

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Format</th>
      <th>Mean</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>xy_motor_mounts</strong>_x4.stl
      </td>
      <td>File Name</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        xy_motor_mounts_<strong style={{ color: "#ffd800" }}>x2</strong>.stl
      </td>
      <td>Quantity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>[a]</strong>_top_shear_x4.stl
      </td>
      <td>Accent Color 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>[b]</strong>_z_joint_back.stl
      </td>
      <td>Accent Color 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
## Material

> ### [ABS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene)

- You need to print most of the parts with ABS material. ABS provides high temperature resistance compared with other common 3D printing materials. ABS's glass temperature is around 105°C (221°F) so its ideal for the parts that exposed to heat such as motor mounts. We highly recommend ABS for the 3D printed parts.

> ### [PETG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate)

- PETG might be the second best option to print parts out of it. PETG has glass temperature around 85°C (185°F). It's not recommended for enclosed printers.

> ### [PLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid)

- PLA is the worst option to use for areas exposed to heat because of the glass temperature. PLA's glass temperature is around 60°C (140°F). But you can still use PLA for panel trims or skirts.

## Tools

#### You should have acces to these tools for better build experience;

> - Caliper
> - Multimeter
> - Crim Tools
> - Crimps
> - Hex Key Set
> - Set of Screwdrivers
> - Locksmith Angle
> - Wire Stripper
> - Soldering Iron _(Not mandatory but good to have one)_
