# Terminology 
 >In this section, we will explore the terminology related to the terms you might come across when assembling a printer.

## Axis Twist
>Axis Twist refers to a phenomenon where the axes of a 3D printer become misaligned or twisted, which can negatively impact print quality and accuracy. This issue typically arises due to mechanical or structural problems and can affect the printer's performance in various ways.

## Blind Joint
>A blind joint refers to a type of connection where the joining elements or fasteners are hidden from one or both sides of the assembly. In 3D printing and mechanical design, this is commonly used when aesthetic considerations or functional constraints require a seamless surface without visible screws or joints.

## Eddy Current
>Eddy Current is a phenomenon in electromagnetism where circulating currents, known as eddy currents, are induced in conductors when they are exposed to a changing magnetic field. These currents flow in closed loops within the conductor and can have several practical implications. Eddy Current probes (such as; BTT Eddy, Cartographer, Beacon) are using that phenomenon to perform.

## G-code
>G-code is a language used to control CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines, including 3D printers. It consists of a series of commands that direct the machine to perform specific actions, such as moving the toolhead, extruding filament, or changing the temperature.

## Input Shaping
>Input Shaping is a technique used in control systems, particularly in 3D printers, to reduce or eliminate vibrations and oscillations that can occur during operation. It helps improve the accuracy and quality of the final output by compensating for the dynamic responses of the system.

## LDO Stepper Naming
>LDO Motors is a leading and reliable manufacturer of stepper motors, and they are also a partner in our project. The Crossant uses LDO motors by default. Understanding the LDO motor naming system is essential for proper component selection and integration.

### Example Naming

## MCU
>MCU stands for Microcontroller Unit. It is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern specific tasks within an embedded system. MCUs are essentially small computers on a single chip, and they are used to control a wide variety of devices and systems.

## Maxwell Coupling
>The Maxwell Kinematic system consists of three V-shaped grooves that are oriented to the center of the part, while the mating part has three curved surfaces that sit down into the three grooves. Each of the three v-grooves provides two contact points for a total of six. This design benefits from symmetry and therefore easier manufacturing techniques. Also, the Maxwell coupling is thermally stable due to this symmetry as the curved surfaces can expand or contract in unison in the v-grooves.

## PID
>A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.

## Pressure Advance
>Pressure Advance is a calibration technique used in 3D printing to improve the accuracy of filament extrusion during the print process. It addresses the delay between the movement of the printer’s extruder and the actual flow of filament, which can affect print quality.

## SBC
>SBC stands for Single-Board Computer. It refers to a complete computer built on a single circuit board, integrating all the necessary components such as the processor, memory, storage, and input/output interfaces like Raspberry Pi or BTT Pi.

## SPI
>SPI stands for Serial Peripheral Interface, a synchronous serial communication protocol used to transfer data between a master device and one or more peripheral devices. It is commonly used in stepper drivers, accelerometer probes or screens.

## Square Corner Velocity (SCV)
>Square Corner Velocity refers to the speed at which a 3D printer or CNC machine can handle sharp corners or abrupt changes in direction while maintaining precision and quality. It is an important parameter for optimizing the performance of the machine during high-speed operations.

## UART
>UART, which stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, is a hardware communication protocol used for asynchronous serial communication between devices. It is commonly used in stepper drivers in terms of 3D printing.

## PWM
>PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation, a technique used to control the power delivered to electrical devices by varying the width of the pulses in a digital signal. It’s commonly used in various applications, including fan control, LED dimming, and signal modulation.
