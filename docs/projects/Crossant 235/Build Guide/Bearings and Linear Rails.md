# Bearings and Linear Rails
>Linear rails are a type of bearing. The Crossant uses linear rails for movement on each axis. Due to their working principles, linear rails and bearings require lubrication, and without it, they wear out over time and lose performance. On this page, we will discuss the terminology related to linear rails and bearings, as well as how to perform their maintenance.

## Bearings
>For the Crossant, it's recommended to use 2RS bearings, as they feature rubber seals on both sides, making lubrication easier and helping to protect against contaminants.
>
>To lubricate the bearings, you can use grease. Here's how: Remove the rubber seals, apply a small amount of grease inside, reseal the bearings, spin them a few times by hand, and they'll be ready for assembly.
>:::tip
>When putting the shafts through out the bearings, lubricate the shafts with a thin machine oil to prevent rust formation over time, which can cause the bearings to seize with the shaft.

## Linear Rails
> To ensure the best performance of the linear rails on your Crossant, it is crucial to properly clean and lubricate them. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Cleaning and Lubrication Guide
>#### Materials Needed:
- Lithium EP2 grease
- Clean, lint-free cloths or paper towels
- Isopropyl alcohol 99%
- Small brush or cotton swabs
- Nitrile gloves (optional)

#### Steps:

>1. **Preparation:**
   - Wear nitrile gloves to keep the rails clean from oils and dirt from your hands.
   - Lay out your materials in a clean workspace.
>
>2. **Cleaning the Rails:**
   - Remove the linear rails from the packaging.
   - Wipe down each rail with a clean, lint-free cloth to remove any dust or debris.
   - Dampen a cloth or paper towel with isopropyl alcohol and thoroughly clean the rails. Ensure you remove any residue from the manufacturing process.
   - Use a small brush or cotton swabs dipped in isopropyl alcohol to clean hard-to-reach areas, especially the grooves of the rails.
>
>3. **Drying the Rails:**
   - Allow the rails to air dry completely. This should take only a few minutes, as alcohol evaporates quickly.
>
>4. **Applying the Grease:**
   - Once the rails are dry, it's time to apply the lithium EP2 grease.
   - Apply a small amount of grease to directly onto the rail.
   - Spread the grease evenly along the length of the rail. Make sure it covers all surfaces, including the grooves.
   - Use a small brush or your fingers (with gloves) to work the grease into the moving parts.
 >:::note
 >We do not recommend using Teflon-based lubrication solutions for the linear rails. Teflon causes the bearings to slide instead of roll, which significantly reduces the lifespan of the rails.
>
>
>5. **Assembling the Rails:**
   - Carefully install the lubricated rails onto the printer according to the assembly guide.
   - Move the carriages along the rails a few times to distribute the grease evenly.
>:::caution
To prevent the bearings from falling out, make sure to use a guide when installing the rail carriages onto the rails.
>
>6. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Periodically check the rails for any buildup of dirt or debris.
   - Reapply grease as needed, typically every few months or after extensive use.
>
>By following these steps, you will ensure that your Crossant's linear rails remain in optimal condition, providing smooth and precise movements for high-quality prints.
