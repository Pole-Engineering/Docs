## Overview
You've probably reached the most challenging part, the gantry assembly. Once we get through this stage, there isn't much left to do!

## 2.1 Assembly
> 
 > There are two distinct assemblies related to the positioning of pulleys and idlers, as well as differences in shear. (Motor Assembly A on the left, Motor Assembly B on the right)
 >
 > - You will be specified the common steps in both assemblies.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/motorassembly-a.png) 
 
### a) Coupling & Shaft
 > - First, secure the coupling to the motor shaft using the [3D printed coupling guide](https://github.com/Pole-Engineering/Crossant-235/blob/main/STLs/Gantry/joint_tensioner_x4.stl), and then push the 70mm shaft into the coupling as far as it can go and secure it.
 > - This step is common for both assemblies and repeat this process for 4 times.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/motorshaftassembly.png) 

 ### b) Motor Mounts
 > - Now, you need to mount the stepper motor to the [motor mount](https://github.com/Pole-Engineering/Crossant-235/blob/main/STLs/Gantry/xy_motor_mount_x4.stl) using four M3x25mm bolts. Also, don't forget to prepare the M4x20 screws and T-nuts to secure the motor mounts to the frame.
 > - This step is common for both assemblies and repeat this process for 4 times.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/motormount1.PNG) 
  
  ### c) Top & Bottom Shaft Supports
 > - Next, you need to prepare the top and bottom shaft supports. We press-fit 625ZZ or 625RS2 bearings into the 3D printed parts to ensure a secure fit. Also, don't forget to prepare the M4x8 screws and T-nuts to secure the motor mounts to the frame.
 > - This step is common for both assemblies and repeat this process for all the top and bottom shaft supports.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/topshear.png) 

   ### d) Fixed Rails
 > - Prepare the bolts and T-nuts that will be used to secure the rails to the frame, you need to first get them ready for installation
 > - You need to prepare all the 4 fixed rails.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/fixed-rails-assembly.png) 
 > 
 > - Mount the rails to the locations shown in the lower photo, but do not tighten the bolts too much; we will adjust the exact positioning later.
 >
 >:::caution
 > - Mount the rails with carriage on it otherwise you wont be able to install the blocks.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/fixed-rails-overview.png) 
 >::: 
 >:::tip 
 Use rail centering tool.
   
   ### e) Cross Rails & XY-Joints 
   
 > - You're starting to prepare the XY joints, first by attaching the nut and bolt that will secure the rail in place by tightening it.
 > - Repeat this process for all the XY joints.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/xy-joint.PNG) 
 >
 > - Now you can place the rail in position, but fully tightening the bolt may make the assembly more difficult. Tighten the bolt that secures the rail, but not completely.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/xy-joint-rail.PNG) 
 
 >:::caution
 > - To assemble the XY joints, you'll need to loosen and slide the extrusions marked in blue in the pictures below a bit.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/blue-extrusion.png) 
 >
 > - Frame should look like this before the XY Joints assembly.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/before-assembly.png) 
 >:::caution
 > - You can use M3x35mm screws to secure the XY joints to the rails.Also dont forget to mount the rail ends.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/xyjoint-fix.png) 
 >
 >  - Now you can correct the extrusion positions.

  ### f) Shaft Supports and Motor Mounts Mounting
 > - We've come to assemble the shaft supports!
 > - As I mentioned in the [Motor Mounts](/docs/assembly-guide/crossant/gantry/#b-motor-mounts) section so pay attention to instructions.
 >
 >![Gantry](../../../static/img/gantry-assembly/top-shaft-supports.png) 
 >
 > - Mount the Top Shaft Support A to the front-left and rear-right, and Top Shaft Support B to the front-right and rear-left with using M4x8 bolts and T-Nuts, as specified.
