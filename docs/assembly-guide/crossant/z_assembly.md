## Assembly 
You can configure the printer with 3 different Z systems, but currently, only the assembly for the leadscrew Z version is available

### a) Mounting the Rails
>First, you need to attach the MGN9H 300mm rails, which will carry the Z-axis, to the frame using M3x8 socket head screws and M3 T-nuts.
>:::tip 
>Use the [rail centering tool](https://github.com/Pole-Engineering/Crossant-235) for proper installation.

### b) Preparing the Joints
>
>Now, you need to prepare the Z joints by following the steps below:
>
>- Insert OD4 50mm rods:
>Gently push the OD4 50mm rods inward from the front locations of the part. Be careful, as the part can crack.
>
>- Secure the T8 nut:
>Secure the T8 nut using 4 M3x15 screws and 4 locknuts. However, do not tighten the nuts all the way. The nuts should be able to move easily in both axes to eliminate Z > wobble.
