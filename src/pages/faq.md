# Frequently Askes Questions
Here is the frequently asked questions about the project and crossant;

 ## What is Crossant?
> The Crosant235 is an advanced, affordable 3D printer featuring a cross-kinematic system with various configuration options. Our goal is to provide users with high-quality prints without breaking the bank.

  ## What does Crossant235 mean?
> In the early stage of the project, it was decided that the printer size would be 150mm² or 180mm² and that it would have a crossed gantry design. Therefore, the name "Crossant" was created by combining the words "cross" and "ant" to signify both the crossed gantry and the small size. And obviously 235 stands for 235mm².

 ## I am new to these stuff, can I still build a Crossant??
>The challenges posed by the cross-XY kinematics that form the foundation of Crossant may be daunting for someone new to these projects. However, don't worry! We have an excellent Discord server with hundreds of people ready to assist you, a comprehensive assembly guide and a well-prepared website to guide you through every step.

 ## How long will it take to build a Crossant from scratch?
>We believe an average user can complete Crossant from scratch in approximately 15 hours.

 ## Does Pole Engineering design anything other than the Crossant?
>Of course, we're not just designing the Crossant. While we're currently focused on the Crossant as our debut project, we plan to share other 3D printers and a variety of DIY projects in the future.

 ## Is there a ready-made kit available for Crossant?
>Right now, there isn't one, but it will be available very soon! We are actively working with BTT on the Crossant 235 kit.

 ## How can I access detailed information about the project?
